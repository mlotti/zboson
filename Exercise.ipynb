In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. It also effects to the situation that the measurement of the transverse momentum is easily depended for example from the orientation of the muon chambers, from the division of the material of the detector and from the magnetic field.
